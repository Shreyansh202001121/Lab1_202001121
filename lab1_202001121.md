### Q1
#### Functional Requirments:
* Allowing administration to add and/or remove users from LIS.
* Allow users to search for a book
  * Search option can further be evolved as
    * By Genre
    * By author
    * By Year
* Search bar to normal type and search
* Once a book is issued / borrowed, auto update the availability. 
* Allow users to borrow / issue book(s) only if it is available.
* Allow users to renew or extend the bookâ€™s borrow / issue.
* Alert and reminders for return date of a book to users.
* Fine depending on the type and condition of book.
* Alert and Mail to a user that he / she has issued a book.
* Authentication system for user and admin login to a system.
* Admin should be able to add or remove book when newly purchased or sold.

 #### Non Functional Requirements:
* UI and Accessibility:
  * A Web application, intuitively and graphically usable.
* Performance:
  * Searching should be as optimal as possible.
  * Multiple users and requests should be handled by the system.
* Scalability: It should be scalable. Should be able to maintain lossless database transaction.
* Maintainability: It should be easily maintainable, features should be clearly visible rather than hidden in UI.
* Reliability:
  * Issue and return transactions should be atomic.
  * In case of crash, system should return to the previous state without any data loss.


### Q2
#### Scope:

A sizable majority of people suffer from hearing loss in one way or another. The proposed programme satisfies each user's specific needs. Users of this software can hear numerous noises in their immediate environment. They may look around by using their Android devices. It runs in real time, monitoring the surroundings for predetermined sounds like car horns, sirens, and other noises, and notifying the user via haptic feedback when these sounds are detected. The application enables users to remain attentive and protected while still being linked to their surroundings.

### Features:
* AI-based surveillance that is real-time
* A trait of haptics
* Large sound library with preset noises.
* Customizable sound addition and removal.
* Adaptable alerts
* An application should always be operating in the background.
### Functional Requirment: 
* UI and accessibility: 
  * The user interface ought to be appealing and simple. 
  * It ought to be simple to access on Android and iOS devices.	
* Performance:
  * The sounds should be easy for the application to process in real time.
  * There ought not be any idleness in alarms.
* Reliability
  * The program should continue to run in the background.
  * It is necessary to accurately recognize the sounds.
  * The user ought to be notified in the event of an application failure.
* Maintainability:
  * Some necessary sounds, like car horns and fire alarms, should not be removed from the list of recognized sounds.
  * The reset button ought to be able to bring back earlier sounds.
